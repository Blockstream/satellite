# Satellite Base Station Kit

The Satellite Base Station Kit includes the parts required for a receiver setup based on a Sat-IP all-in-one antenna. The kit is available on [Blockstream Store](https://store.blockstream.com/products/blockstream-satellite-base-station/).

Note that the Base Station only works in the Ku band. Hence, please make sure you are covered by a Ku-band beam before purchasing it. That is, the Base Station is appropriate for receiving from the Galaxy 18, Telstar 11N (Africa and Europe), and the Telstar 18V Ku-band beams. In contrast, it is incompatible with the C-band beam from Telstar 18V.

If you would like to purchase the parts on your own, you can acquire the following items:

1. [Selfsat>IP22](https://www.selfsat.com/homeantenna) all-in-one Sat-IP flat-panel antenna.
2. Ethernet Cat5e cable.
3. Power over Ethernet (PoE) injector.

The PoE injector is only necessary if the Ethernet port you plan to connect to the Base Station does not support [Power over Ethernet (PoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet) natively.
