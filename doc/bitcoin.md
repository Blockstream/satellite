## Overview

[Bitcoin Satellite](https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite) is a fork of [FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine)](https://bitcoinfibre.org) and, consequently, also a fork of [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org). It features a version of the bitcoind application with support for the reception of blocks sent over satellite in UDP datagrams with multicast addressing. You can find detailed information regarding how Bitcoin Satellite works on the project's [Wiki page](https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite/wiki).

## Installation

Install bitcoin-satellite by running:

```
blocksat-cli deps install --btc
```

> NOTE:
>
> - This command supports the two most recent releases of Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, and Raspbian.
>
> - bitcoin-satellite is a fork of bitcoin core. As such, it installs applications with the same name (i.e., `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, `bitcoin-qt`, and `bitcoin-tx`). Hence, the installation of `bitcoin-satellite` will fail if you already have bitcoin core installed.

Alternatively, you can install bitcoin-satellite manually [from binary packages](#installation-from-binary-packages) or [from source](#compilation-from-source).

## Configuration

Next, you need to generate a `bitcoin.conf` file with configurations to receive bitcoin data via satellite. To do so, run:

```
blocksat-cli btc
```

By default, this command will place the generated `bitcoin.conf` file at `~/.bitcoin/`, which is the default Bitcoin [data directory](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory) used by Bitcoin Satellite. If you so desire, you can specify an alternative `datadir` as follows:
```
blocksat-cli btc -d datadir
```

## Running

Next, run `bitcoind` as usual, like so:

```
bitcoind
```

Note that other Bitcoin Core options are supported and can be added to the generated `bitcoin.conf` file as needed, or directly as arguments to the above command. For example, you can run the node based on satellite links only (unplugged from the internet) using option `connect=0` on `bitcoin.conf` or by running:

```
bitcoind -connect=0
```

Also, you can run `bitcoind` in daemon mode:

```
bitcoind -daemon
```

Once `bitcoind` is running, you can check the satellite interface is receiving data by running the following command:

```
bitcoin-cli getudpmulticastinfo
```

If the receiver is correctly locked to the satellite signal, you should see a bitrate around 1.09 Mbps.

Furthermore, you can check the number of blocks being received concurrently over satellite with the following command:

```
bitcoin-cli getchunkstats
```

## Further Information

### UDP Multicast Reception Option

In a Blockstream Satellite receiver setup, the satellite receiver will decode and output a UDP/IPv4 stream. Bitcoin Satellite, in turn, listens to such a stream when configured with option `udpmulticast` (added to the `bitcoin.conf` file).

There are several possibilities regarding the configuration of option `udpmulticast`. It depends on your hardware setup (for instance, your [receiver type](hardware.md#supported-receiver-options)) and the satellite that you are receiving from. The option is described as follows:

```
 -udpmulticast=<if>,<dst_ip>:<port>,<src_ip>,<trusted>[,<label>]
```

> Listen to multicast-addressed UDP messages sent by <src_ip> towards <dst_ip>:<port> using interface <if>. Set <trusted> to 1 if sender is a trusted node. An optional <label> may be defined for the multicast group in order to facilitate inspection of logs.

Here is an example:

```
udpmulticast=dvb0_0,239.0.0.2:4434,172.16.235.9,1,blocksat
```

In this case, we have that:

- `dvb0_0` is the name of the network interface that receives data out of the receiver.
- `239.0.0.2:4434` is the destination IP address and port of the packets that are sent over satellite.
- `172.16.235.9` is the IP address of the Blockstream ground station node broadcasting data over the satellite network (each satellite has a unique source IP address).
- `1` configures this stream as coming from a *trusted* source, which is helpful to speed-up block reception.
- `blocksat` is a label used simply to facilitate inspection of logs.

To simplify the process, command `blocksat-cli btc` generates the `bitcoin.conf` file for you.


### Installation from Binary Packages

You can install `bitcoin-satellite` directly from binary packages that are available for the two most recent Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, and Raspbian releases.

Ubuntu:

```
add-apt-repository ppa:blockstream/satellite
apt-get update
apt-get install bitcoin-satellite
```

> If command `add-apt-repository` is not available, install `software-properties-common`.

Debian:

```
add-apt-repository https://aptly.blockstream.com/satellite/debian/
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
    --recv-keys 87D07253F69E4CD8629B0A21A94A007EC9D4458C
apt-get update
apt-get install bitcoin-satellite
```

> Install `gnupg`, `apt-transport-https`, and `software-properties-common`, if necessary.

Raspbian:

```
add-apt-repository https://aptly.blockstream.com/satellite/raspbian/
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
    --recv-keys 87D07253F69E4CD8629B0A21A94A007EC9D4458C
apt-get update
apt-get install bitcoin-satellite
```

> Install `gnupg`, `apt-transport-https`, and `software-properties-common`, if necessary.

Fedora:

```
dnf copr enable blockstream/satellite
dnf install bitcoin-satellite
```

> If command `dnf copr enable` is not available, install `dnf-plugins-core`.

CentOS:

```
yum copr enable blockstream/satellite
yum install bitcoin-satellite
```

> If command `yum copr enable` is not available, install `yum-plugin-copr`.

### Compilation from Source

To build Bitcoin Satellite from source, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite.git
cd bitcoinsatellite/
```

Then, install all build requirements listed [in the project's documentation](https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#dependency-build-instructions-ubuntu--debian).

Next, run:

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

This will build the `bitcoind` application binary within the `src/` directory and you can execute it from there. Alternatively, you can install the application in your system:

```
make install
```

Detailed build instructions can be found within [the project's documentation ](https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite/tree/master/doc#building).
