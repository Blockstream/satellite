This page summarizes several frequencies of interest.

## Signal Bands

Blockstream Satellite operates in Ku high band, Ku low band and C band, depending on region. Ku high band is used in North America and South America. Ku low band is used in Africa, Europe, and Asia. C band is used in the Asia-Pacific region.

| Band         | Frequency Range   |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| C band       | 3.7 GHZ - 4.2 GHz |
| Ku low band  | 10.7 to 11.7 GHz  |
| Ku high band | 11.7 to 12.75 GHz |
