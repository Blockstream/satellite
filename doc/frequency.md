This page summarizes several frequencies of interest.

## Signal Bands

Blockstream Satellite operates in Ku high band, Ku low band and C band, depending on the region. Ku high band is used in North America and South America. Ku low band is used in Africa, Europe, and Asia. C band is used in the Asia-Pacific region.

| Band         | Frequency Range   |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| C band       | 3.7 GHZ - 4.2 GHz |
| Ku low band  | 10.7 to 11.7 GHz  |
| Ku high band | 11.7 to 12.75 GHz |

## Signal Frequencies

The following table summarizes the transmission bands, frequencies, and polarizations of the signals broadcast in each coverage region:

| Satellite          | Band    | Polarization | Frequency   |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Galaxy 18          | Ku High | Horizontal   | 11913.4 MHz |
| Telstar 11N Africa | Ku Low  | Horizontal   | 11452.1 MHz |
| Telstar 11N Europe | Ku Low  | Vertical     | 11505.4 MHz |
| Telstar 18V Ku     | Ku Low  | Horizontal   | 11507.9 MHz |
| Telstar 18V C      | C       | Vertical     | 4122.6 MHz  |

## L-band Frequencies

Next, the following table summarizes the L-band frequencies to be used in each region based on the typical LNB local oscillator (LO) frequencies:

| LO Frequency        | 5150 MHz   | 9750 MHz   | 10600 MHz  | 10750 MHz  |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Galaxy 18           |            |            | 1313.4 MHz | 1163.4 MHz |
| Telstar 11N Africa  |            | 1702.1 MHz |            |            |
| Telstar 11N Europe  |            | 1755.4 MHz |            |            |
| Telstar 18V Ku Band |            | 1757.9 MHz |            |            |
| Telstar 18V C Band  | 1027.4 MHz |            |            |            |
