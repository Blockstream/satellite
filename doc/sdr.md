## Connections

The SDR setup is connected as follows:

![SDR Connections](img/sdr_connections.png?raw=true "SDR Connections")

- Connect the RTL-SDR USB dongle to your host PC.
- Connect the **non-powered** port of the power supply (labeled as “Signal to
  IRD”) to the RTL-SDR using an SMA cable and an SMA-to-F adapter.
- Connect the **powered** port (labeled “Signal to SWM”) of the power supply to
  the LNB using a coaxial cable (an RG6 cable is recommended).

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT connect the powered port of the power supply to the SDR
interface. Permanent damage may occur to your SDR and/or your computer.

## Software Requirements

The SDR-based setup relies on the applications listed below:

- [leandvb](http://www.pabr.org/radio/leandvb/leandvb.en.html): a software-based
  DVB-S2 receiver application.
- [rtl_sdr](https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr): reads samples taken by the
  RTL-SDR and feeds them into
  [leandvb](http://www.pabr.org/radio/leandvb/leandvb.en.html).
- [TSDuck](https://tsduck.io/): unpacks the output of leandvb and produces
  IP packets to be fed to [Bitcoin Satellite](bitcoin.md).
- [Gqrx](https://gqrx.dk): useful for spectrum visualization during antenna
  pointing.

To install them all at once, run:

```
blocksat-cli deps install
```

> NOTE: This command supports Ubuntu (18.04, 19.10, and 20.04), Fedora (30, 31,
> and 32), and CentOS 7. In case you are using another Linux distribution or
> version, please refer to the [manual compilation and installation
> instructions](#manual-compilation-of-sdr-software).

If you prefer to install all software components manually, please refer to the
[manual installation section](#manual-installation-of-sdr-software).

## Configuration

After installing, you can generate the configurations that are needed for gqrx
by running:

```
blocksat-cli gqrx-conf
```

> NOTE: this assumes you are going to use gqrx with an RTL-SDR dongle.

## Running

You should now be ready to launch the SDR receiver. You can run it by executing:

```
blocksat-cli sdr
```

More specifically, as thoroughly explained in the [Antenna Pointing
Guide](antenna-pointing.md#sdr-based), you might want to run with specific gain
and de-rotation parameters that are suitable to your setup, like so:

```
blocksat-cli sdr -g [gain] --derotate [freq_offset]
```

where `[gain]` and `[freq_offset]` should be substituted by the appropriate
values.

Furthermore, in the SDR setup, you must choose which stream you would like to
receive from the two streams that are simultaneously broadcast through the
Blockstream Satellite network (refer to more information in the [Antenna
Pointing Guide](antenna-pointing.md#optimize-the-snr)).

By default, the application will try to decode the low-throughput stream. To try
decoding the high-throughput stream, run with option `-m high`, as follows:

```
blocksat-cli sdr -g [gain] --derotate [freq_offset] -m high
```

## Next Steps

At this point, if your antenna is already correctly pointed, you should be able
to start receiving data on Bitcoin Satellite. Please follow the [instructions
for Bitcoin Satellite configuration](bitcoin.md). If your antenna is not pointed
yet, refer to the [antenna alignment guide](antenna-pointing.md).

## Further Information

### Software Updates

To update the SDR software to the most recent releases, run:

```
blocksat-cli deps update
```

### Docker

There is a Docker image available in this repository for running the SDR host on
a container. Please refer to instructions in the [Docker
guide](../docker/README.md).

### Manual Installation of SDR Software

If you do not wish to rely on the automatic installation handled by command
`blocksat-cli deps install`, you can install all applications manually.

First, enable our repository for binary packages. On Ubuntu/Debian, run:

```
apt-add-repository ppa:blockstream/satellite
apt-get update
```

> If command `apt-add-repository` is not available in your system, install
> package `software-properties-common`.

On Fedora, run:
```
dnf copr enable blockstream/satellite
```

> If command `copr enable` is not available in your system, install package
> `dnf-plugins-core`.

Finally, install the applications:

```
sudo apt install rtl-sdr leandvb tsduck gqrx-sdr
```
or
```
sudo dnf install rtl-sdr leandvb tsduck gqrx
```

### Manual Compilation of SDR Software

If `leandvb` and (or) `tsduck` are not available as binary packages in your
distribution, you can build and install them from source.

#### Leandvb from source

To build leandvb from source, first install the dependencies:

```
apt install git make g++ libx11-dev
```
or
```
dnf install git make g++ libX11-devel
```

Then, run:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Blockstream/leansdr.git
cd leansdr/src/apps
make
sudo install leandvb /usr/bin
```

Next, build and install `ldpc_tool`:

```
cd ../../LDPC/
make CXX=g++ ldpc_tool
sudo install ldpc_tool /usr/bin
```

#### TSDuck from source

To build and install TSDuck from source, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck.git
cd tsduck
build/install-prerequisites.sh
make NOTELETEXT=1 NOSRT=1 NOPCSC=1 NOCURL=1 NODTAPI=1
sudo make NOTELETEXT=1 NOSRT=1 NOPCSC=1 NOCURL=1 NODTAPI=1 install
```
