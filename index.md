# Blockstream Satellite

## Overview

The Blockstream Satellite network broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain worldwide
24/7 for free, protecting against network interruptions and providing areas
without reliable internet connection with the opportunity to use Bitcoin. You
can join this network by running your own Blockstream Satellite receiver
node. This document guides you over all the hardware options, software
components, and assembly instructions.

The first step to get started is to verify whether your location has satellite
coverage and clear line-of-sight to the satellite in the sky. You can confirm
the coverage by looking at our [Coverage
Map](https://blockstream.com/satellite/#satellite_network-coverage). After that,
make sure your satellite view does not have any obstacles, such as trees or
buildings. You can find the target area in the sky by using the antenna
[pointing angles](doc/antenna-pointing.md#mount-the-antenna) provided by our
coverage map or by using an augmented reality app such as the Satellite Pointer
(available for
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/satellite-pointer/id994565490) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tda.satpointer)).

The second step is to get the required hardware. The quickest option is to
purchase a ready-to-use [Satellite
Kit](https://store.blockstream.com/product-category/satellite_kits/). However,
as detailed [in this guide](doc/hardware.md), there is a range of other options
to suit your needs.

Third, you need to prepare a host computer with a few software components. One
of them is the [Bitcoin
Satellite](https://github.com/Blockstream/bitcoinsatellite/) application, a fork
of Bitcoin Core with custom capabilities to receive the Bitcoin blocks and
transactions arriving from space. As detailed later, this step is greatly
facilitated by the Blockstream Satellite command-line interface (CLI) tool,
which handles all the necessary software installations.

Once you get your receiver node up and running, there is a lot that you can do
with it. You can use it as a satellite-connected Bitcoin node offering
redundancy and protection from internet failures to connected
peers. Alternatively, you can run it as your primary Bitcoin full node, either
with hybrid connectivity (internet and satellite) or satellite-connected
only. The satellite network broadcasts new blocks and transactions, as well as
the complete block history. Hence, you can synchronize the entire blockchain
from scratch using the satellite connection only.

You can also send your own encrypted messages worldwide through the satellite
network using our [Satellite API](doc/api.md) while paying for each transmission
through the Lightning Network. Moreover, if you run a Lightning node, you can
sync it faster through [Lightning gossip snapshots](doc/api.md#lightning-gossip-snapshots)
sent over satellite. You can even
[download the Bitcoin source code](doc/api.md#bitcoin-source-code-messages)
over satellite and bootstrap the node without ever touching the internet.

The remainder of this guide covers the essential steps to get you started. In
summary, you will need to:

1. Get the required hardware, such as a
   [DVB-S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S2) receiver and a compatible
   satellite antenna.
2. Install all software requirements, configure the receiver, and configure the
   host.
3. Align your satellite dish appropriately to receive the Blockstream Satellite
   signal.
4. Run the Bitcoin Satellite and Satellite API applications.

A [quick reference guide](doc/quick-reference.md) is available if you are
familiar with the commands and steps of the process. Moreover, if you have
purchased a [satellite
kit](https://store.blockstream.com/product-category/satellite_kits/), you can
follow the kit-specific instructions available on [Blockstream's Help
Center](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001613686).
Otherwise, we recommend continuing on this guide. You can proceed to the next
section, which covers the [hardware options](doc/hardware.md).
